## SecureNest: Smart Home Security System

SecureNest is a smart home security system that uses face recognition and object detection to identify authorized individuals and vehicles. It was developed as part of my 3rd year mini project and presented at ICTEST 2025.

## Project Summary

SecureNest captures and verifies faces using a trained model and grants access only to authorized users. It can also raise alerts in case of unrecognized individuals, helping improve safety in home environments.
